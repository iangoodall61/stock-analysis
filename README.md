# Stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

Steve enjoyed our first analysis of the DQ stock and now would like us to take it a step further. I am refactoring the VBA code we already made for Steve, in order to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. We are hoping that the refactored code will make our analysis run faster and produce the same results as before. 

## Results

My refactored code ran but it was only showing the stock prices for AY. I tried adjusting it many times and could not seem to trouble shoot my issues by the deadline. I had issues with writing the IF then statement to increase the ticker index, and every line I wrote it would send back an error message. The refactored code seemed to run faster than the initial VBA we wrote for the module, but I can only assume that is true because it was only generating the stock prices for AY.

## Summary

### Advantages of a refactored code

An advantage of a refactored code is that it really simplifies and cleans up the code. It makes it easier to read through and understand, and in the end, it enhances the quality of the code. 

### Disadvantages of a refactored code 

A disadvantage of a refactored code is that if the developer does not completely understand the code elements the refactored code would create issues when trying to manipulate it. This was the issue I ran into when trying to refactor the code for this challenge.
